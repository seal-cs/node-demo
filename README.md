# node-demo

A demo project, using a Jenkins DSL file, describing a Jenkins job for creating a NodeJS demo application, distributed as Docker image.

The project was inspired by Edward Viaene (https://github.com/wardviaene) and his Udemy course "Learn DevOps: CI/CD with Jenkins using Pipelines and Docker".
